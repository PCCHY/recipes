INGREDIENTS
2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs 
1/2 cup butter, melted 
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened 
1 (14 ounce) can chocolate-flavored sweetened condensed milk 
2 eggs 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips 
3 teaspoons vegetable oil 
2 tablespoons crushed peppermint candies

DIRECTIONS
1.Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with foil baking cups.
2.Combine chocolate wafer crumbs and butter in a medium bowl; divide mixture evenly among the prepared muffin cups, pressing firmly to form crusts.
3.Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 6 minutes. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Keep oven on.
4.Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Beat in sweetened condensed milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract into a smooth filling. Divide filling evenly over the cooled crusts.
5.Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Remove foil baking cups gently.
6.Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over cheesecake bites and sprinkle with peppermint candies. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
